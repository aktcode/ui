### UI components that can be usefull and fun.

Building various UI components or basically anything on a codebase that is minimal and easy to work on. The project aims to compile various components/objects that one could imagine, by keeping things both integrated(to reduce unnecessary keeping up) and isolated(to easily pull out components) simultaneously. The components have been distributed into categories and the <b>Others</b> category is the one to look out as it can contain anything.
